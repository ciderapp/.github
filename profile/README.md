## About Us ðŸ’»

Starting off as **[Apple Music Electron](https://github.com/ciderapp/Apple-Music-Electron)** we strove to build a open source client for Apple Music that wasn't caught up in Apple's horrible locked in ecosystem and allows for some breath-ability in your experience. This project was later replaced with what we have today called Cider.

**[Cider](https://github.com/ciderapp/Cider)** is AME's successor by blood and uses a localized Vue.js page that allows for easy media playback and multi-platform support using Electron.
