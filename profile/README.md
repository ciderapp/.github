# Cider Collective, LLC

## About Us 💻
Cider Collective, LLC is an international team of passionate developers, designers, and music enthusiasts dedicated to revolutionizing the Apple Music experience. Our journey began with [Apple Music Electron](https://github.com/ciderapp/Apple-Music-Electron) and evolved into [**Cider 1**](https://github.com/ciderapp/Cider), an open-source project designed to bring freedom and customization to music streaming.  

Today, **Cider 2** represents the culmination of our vision. Built on a completely new codebase, Cider 2 is a modern, **closed-source** application that offers unparalleled performance, a polished user experience, and extensive customization options.
