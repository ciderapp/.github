## Cider Collective, LLC

### About Us 💻
Starting off as an indie project called [Apple Music Electron](https://github.com/ciderapp/Apple-Music-Electron), we strived to build an open-source client for Apple Music that wasn't caught up in Apple's locked-in ecosystem and allowed for breathability in your experience. This project later evolved into what we now call [**Cider**](https://github.com/ciderapp/Cider).

[**Cider**](https://github.com/ciderapp/Cider) is the spiritual successor of [AME](https://github.com/ciderapp/Apple-Music-Electron). It utilizes localized Vue.js and Rust for a fast and efficient experience while maintaining maximum interoperability between Apple's services.
